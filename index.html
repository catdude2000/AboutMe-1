                   My name is Misti Dinzy. I'm 28 years old, so far. I was born here in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I live with my fiance, Dakota, and our 4 pets. <br>
                   We have a Chihuahua named Riku. Two cats, named Dumbledore and Reptar. And a Chinchilla named Tron. <br>
                   We also foster rescue dogs! Our most recent foster, Bean, was found as a stray on the streets in Texas, with his mom and two siblings. The four of them made it all the way to Iowa and found their forever homes.

                   I've had a lot of jobs. My first one was a "courtesy clerk" at Hy-Vee, as soon as I turned 14. Within an 8-year span, I had 15 different jobs. Most of them in some kind of customer service/retail role. I finally realized I don't really vibe with those, and moved to a Quality Assurance position, that I absolutely loved and thrived in for several years. 
                   <!--Unfortunately, my workplace was one that did not slow down or protect its workers when the Covid-19 pandemic came. I have grown up in a family chock-full of loud & proud unionized factory workers...so I have this crazy, stubborn belief that employees should be treated like human beings.-->
