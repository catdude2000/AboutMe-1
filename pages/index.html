                   My name is Misti Dinzy. I'm 28 years old so far. I was born here in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and have only been out of state once. I live with my fiance, Dakota, and our 4 pets. 
                   We have a Chihuahua named Riku. Two cats, named Dumbledore and Reptar. And a Chinchilla named Tron. <br>
                   We also foster rescue dogs! Our most recent foster, Bean, was found as a stray on the streets in Texas, with his mom and two siblings. The four of them made it all the way to Iowa and found their forever homes.
